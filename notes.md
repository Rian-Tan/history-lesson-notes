## Imperialism VS colonialism

Imperialism:

- invloves political and economic control (ideas)

Coloniasm

- involves territorial control (physical land)


## British:
- powerful, civilised
- apex/superior of the human race

View of the colonised:
- "half devil"
- "half-child"
- barbaric / uncivilised

## The british imperial mindset in singapore context

In singapore too, most british government officials believed themselves to be superior

Their attitudes were also racist

## impact (I)

- europians were given priviledged treatement
- Asians were barred from membership of European clubs

## impact (II)

- little local involvement in the government
- -> senior ranks of the civil service were reserved for british of pure Europian decent

## Historical concepts

- change and continuity
- Empathy
- Chronology
- Evidence
- Accounts
- Cause and effect (causation)
- Significance
- Diversity

## Question 3

Answer: Mr tan was embarrassed because he felt underserving of the way Thomas addressed him, which implied that the latter was a subordinate to and of a lower rank than himself. However, given Thomas' race and how the British were deemed superior in singapore, Mr Tan did not feeel that it was proper or acceptable for him, a Chinese, to accept the title of "sir" from a British.

## Activity 2 Question 2

This source shows me that the treatment of Asians by the British during that time was unfair/ discriminatory.

## Causes of WWII In Europe and Asia-Pacific

1. The great depression & how it led to the rise of dictators.
2. Other reasons that led to the outbreak of WWII in Europe
3. Outbreak of WWII in Europe
4. Japan’s response to the Great Depression leading to outbreak of WWII in the Asia-Pacific


Protectionism: America placed tarrifs on imports as an attempt to discourage imports.




## How did the great depression lead to the rise of Dictators?

[Video](https://youtu.be/Ojo8-GhhQcA)

1. How did the Great Depression contribute to the rise of Hitler in Germany?

- Hitler promised remilitarisation
- 6mil ppl with no jobs
- Remilitarisation allowed for more jobs
- Taking resources from other nations

2. How did the different dictators contribute to the outbreak of WWII in Europe?

### Based on your understanding of the video, in your own words, explain how

1. …the Great Depression contributed to the rise of Hitler in Germany.

    - The depression gave hitler a lot of supporters/ attentino and publicity
    - Popularity -> people voted for him
    - Became chancellor 

2. …Hitler’s Germany contributed to the outbreak of WWII in Europe.

    - They became more aggressive 
    - Invaded Austria, Czechoslovakia
    - Invasion of Poland triggered WWII

    - Italy was inspired by Germany's aggression
    - Decided to invade a state weaker than themselves
    - Economy was threatened 

4. …the Great Depression led to Japan attacking Manchuria in 1931

    - Japan's economy bad
    - Thought that attacking their neighbours would help them (bad idea irl dont attack your neighbours)

## Other causes

### Source Based Skill - Purpose

cartoon from slide 14 ^^^

### (Refer to the cartoon in Slide 14) Why did the cartoonist publish this? Explain your answer using details from the source.)


- Author
    - David Low (Political cartoonist,, critical of the appeasement policy)
- Aim + evidence + explain
    - Criticise that the League of Nations was weak. It was depicted as a doormat, stepped upon by Japan. France gave a rather perfunctory bow to the oorat. Britain was putting make-up for the League of nations, trying to make it look good. This shows that the League of Nations had no power to stop Japan’s aggression. Not only did the members like Britain and France not intervene, their actions were depicted as whimsical and ludicrous, further emphasizing the weakness of the League of Nations
- Action Word
    - Influence
- Audience
    - British citizens
- Anticipated Response
    - Angry that the league of nations had no real power to stop aggression / criticize the LON
- Context
    - Japan invaded manchuria, and the league of nations verbally condemned japan. Japan left the LON.

### Meiji restoration: 

## Study source A:

![source A](./sourceA.png "source A")

- What can you infer about the way the Japanese viewed the Russian soldiers? Explain your answer. [4] (Note: You only need to provide 1 inference for this question.)


Inference:
The Japanese viewed the Russian soldiers with contempt/viewed them as weak/inferior.

Evidence: 
This can be seen in the source where the Russian soldiers were depicted as fearful of the Japanese soldiers. One of the Russian soldiers knelt and begged for mercy. The other one appeared to be shrieking in fear. Yet, the Japanese were merely dangling dolls of Japanese soldiers at them.

Explanation:
This tells us that the Japanese regarded the Russians with much derision since the Russian soldiers were so easily frightened - even soldiers of dolls petrified them. 

## Study source B:

![source B](./sourceB.png "source B")

- What can you derive about the way Japan was viewed by the West from 1905? Explain your answer. [4] (Note: You only need to provide 1 inference for this question.)


Inference: 
Japan was viewed as equal by the British

Evidence:
This can be seen in the source in how the figures representing Britain and Japan are both in the foreground of the cartoon, shaking hands and standing on level ground. The Japanese soldier is also not portrayed in a demeaning manner. In addition, the poem accompanying the cartoon proclaims how there is “neither East nor West” and refers to both figures as “Strong men”

Explanation:
This tells us that the British gave full recognition of Japan’s equal standing.

## Source A:

### The geography of Malaya* is a factor in its defence. The coastal plains were about 15 miles in width and filled with mangrove swamps. The mountain range, which runs from north to south is covered with dense jungle and vast areas that are almost unknown. Roads are few and heavily guarded, so that an invading army would be at the mercy of defenders securely hidden in the jungle.

*Malaya - a term that broadly encompasses a set of states on the Malay peninsula and present-day Singapore


How do you think such a report would affect the perceptions and attitudes of…

- The british towards Singapore's defence?
    - British would perceive that it would be easy to defend Singapore/adopt a complacent attitude. According to the source, the coastal plains, mountain range and dense jungle would make it difficult for the invaders. Hence, the british would think that singapore would have the upper hand since the geography of Malaya would work to the advantage of the defenders.

- The locals with regard to how vulnerable Singapore was to attack?
    - The locals would feel that Singapore was not that vulnerable since the dense jungle in Malaya would pose difficulties for invaders. Defenders hiding in the jungle would slow down advancing invaders.

## The fall of Singapore

### Battle of Singapore

- 8-15 Febuary 

### The british surrender

- 15 february 1942
- Decision made by British Lieutenant General Arthur E. Percival in order to avert inevitable massacre



### 28 July 2022

## Task 3: Individual response

- Write a short personal response to the discussion question in your notebooks
- Was it British ineptitude or Japanese superiority that sealed Singapore’s fate in 1942?
- you should:
    - state your stand
    - Explain why


### Answer:

I think it was the British ineptitude that sealed Singapore's fate in 1942. The British did not provide enough aircraft to defend the airfields, had fewer and outdated equipment, did not and failed to recognise the use of tanks, had poor communication as well as a lack of physical and psychological preparedness, lack of training, were quick to retreat, clumsy, unaggressive, Slow, had practical unfamilitary, werent able to swim, didnt deploy resources well and had a lack of good leadership. All these ineptitudes lead to the fall of singapore.
