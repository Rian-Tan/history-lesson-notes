## Imperialism VS colonialism

Imperialism:

- invloves political and economic control (ideas)

Coloniasm

- involves territorial control (physical land)


## British:
- powerful, civilised
- apex/superior of the human race

View of the colonised:
- "half devil"
- "half-child"
- barbaric / uncivilised

## The british imperial mindset in singapore context

In singapore too, most british government officials believed themselves to be superior

Their attitudes were also racist

## impact (I)

- europians were given priviledged treatement
- Asians were barred from membership of European clubs

## impact (II)

- little local involvement in the government
- -> senior ranks of the civil service were reserved for british of pure Europian decent

## Historical concepts

- change and continuity
- Empathy
- Chronology
- Evidence
- Accounts
- Cause and effect (causation)
- Significance
- Diversity

## Question 3

Answer: Mr tan was embarrassed because he felt underserving of the way Thomas addressed him, which implied that the latter was a subordinate to and of a lower rank than himself. However, given Thomas' race and how the British were deemed superior in singapore, Mr Tan did not feeel that it was proper or acceptable for him, a Chinese, to accept the title of "sir" from a British.

## Activity 2 Question 2

This source shows me that the treatment of Asians by the British during that time was unfair/ discriminatory.
